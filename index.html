      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Maira Garcia and and I am aspiring software engineer. I am so excited to start the Coding Bootcamp and learn more about web development. Feel free to look below to learn more about me!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>East Los Angeles, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>jogging, working out at the gym, hikes, long drives, bullet journaling, exploring new places, going to concerts, reading, listening to music and podcasts, and playing with makeup </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It's hard for me to say because I am coming from a non-profit background and so I've worked with people and communities for my whole career journey. But I've had an itch to try coding because I am very interested in learning how things work in computers. Shout out to the best job I had while being an undergrad at UCLA - CLICC! </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Lived in East LA my whole life!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I would like to be a web developer because I am excited to start my own projects and learn the ins and outs of web development. Again, my previous job at UCLA allowed me to look behind the scenes of how web development works and I am intrigued on developing projects that would one day improve someone's life, even for just a couple seconds. </p>
